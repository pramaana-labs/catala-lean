  # Scenario: Employer with no wage payments during the 2023 calendar year
  # Tested law refs: §3301 (6 percent of total wages paid during the calendar year)
  # Legal correlation:
  # - §3301 imposes an excise tax equal to 6 percent of total wages paid during the calendar year.
  # - Here, total wages paid in 2023 are $0, so the tax base is $0 and excise tax must be $0.
  # - The statutory rate is 6% (0.06).
